# NFL Combine Model and Paper
## Project Overview
In this project, my good friend Jackson Filosa and I seek to understand how large of an impact NFL combine results have on career performance.  We focus our study on quarterbacks and running backs.  We also produced an article on our methodologies, findings, and conclusions.

For both quarterbacks and runningbacks, we look at the impact of five combine events: Forty Yard Dash, Vertical Jump, Broad Jump, Cone Drill, and Shuttle Run.  When asssessing quarterbacks, we used Quarterback Rating (QBR) as the response variable.  For runningbacks, we used Yards Per Carry (YPC).  For both positions, we also split the models into two groups: one with the response variable only from the player's first year of play and one including a career average.
